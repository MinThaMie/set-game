<h1>How to play set</h1>
<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  Set is a popular real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 (
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">
    Wikipedia
  </a>
  ). The game is a race to find as many <em>sets</em>, or three-card
  triplets with a certain property, as possible from among the cards in
  the playing area. In this online variant, this is as simple as
  clicking on the three cards when you find a set, and the computer will
  handle all the details of dealing cards and keeping score.

  below.</p>

    Set is played with a special deck of 81 = 3×3×3×3 cards. You can see
    some examples of Set cards above. Each card has four features that
    distinguish it from the others: color, shape, filling, and amount. For
    each feature, there are three variants, as shown in the example.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Colors: green, red/orange, and purple.</li>
      <li>Shapes: ovals, waves, and diamonds.</li>
      <li>Fillings: striped, empty, and filled.</li>
      <li>Amount: one, two, and three.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>What is a set?</h2>
  <p>
    A <em>set</em> is a combination of three cards such that for each of
    the four features, the variants of that feature expressed by the three
    cards are <strong>either all the same or all different</strong>. For
    example, the three cards shown above form a set, because each feature
    is expressed in all three variants between the cards. You can also
    have sets where some features are different and others are the same.
    The three cards below also form a set.
  </p>
    <Card @image="images/oval1half_green.svg"/>
    <Card @image="images/wave2half_green.svg"/>
    <Card @image="images/diamond3half_green.svg"/>
  <p>
    In the example above, the three cards are identical in filling
    (striped) and color (green), while being all different in number and
    shape. In general, some subset of features could be all the same among
    the three cards, with the rest of the features being all different.
    You can verify a couple more examples of sets below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <Card @image="images/wave1half_red.svg"/>
    <Card @image="images/wave2half_green.svg"/>
    <Card @image="images/wave3half_purple.svg"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    <Card @image="images/oval1empty_green.svg"/>
    <Card @image="images/wave1half_green.svg"/>
    <Card @image="images/diamond1solid_green.svg"/>
  </p>

    <p>
      However, a triplet of cards needs to be correct in all four features
      to be a set. The three cards below do <strong>not</strong> form a set,
      due to their color. Two of the cards are green while the third is
      purple, so the three colors are neither all the same, nor all
      different.

  <h2>Game play</h2>
  <p>
    To play Set, 12 cards are dealt from the deck. When a player finds a
    set, they take those three cards from the playing field, and three new
    cards are dealt to replace the ones that were taken. The game ends
    when the deck is empty and no more sets are available, and your score
    is equal to the number of sets you've found.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some rare occasions, there will not be any sets among the 12 cards
    in the playing field. In these cases, the computer will automatically
    deal out 3 extra cards (for a total of 15), and play will resume
    normally. In even rarer cases when there are no sets among these 15
    cards, additional cards will be dealt out in multiples of 3.
